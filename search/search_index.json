They provide us with a donation of expired food each Wednesday. To pick up this donation, arrive behind the building (in the back by the dumpsters). Call the store on their main phone number (419-885-3505) and select option 3 for the produce department. When someone answers, tell them that you are from Food Not Bombs and that you are there to pick up the donation. They will generally indicate that they will bring the donation out; if they don't know about the donation, you could try calling back to reach someone with more information or ask to speak to another member of their department. Phoenix Earth Food Co-op The Co-op is located at 1447 W Sylvania Ave . They provide us with donations every Thursday; they prefer that we pick up the donations Thursday morning around 11:30am. Panera We are currently signed up for Panera donations on Mondays for the Panera branch at 7115 Central Ave . They offer us boxes of their unsold bread and baked goods shortly before they close for the day at 9pm. To pick this up, arrive at the store at about 8:50pm and say that you are picking up the donation. They will likely be working on boxing it up already, and they'll give it to you when they're finished. We often need someone to pick up this donation. Country Grains Delivering or distributing food donations Bread The Panera and Country Grains donations can often be a lot of bread and baked goods. Here are some ideas for what to do with it, offered by River: Pick out stuff me and my household will eat and put a loaf or 2 in the freezer for later. Reach out to friends and make a list of which people would be happy to receive bread, what kinds of stuff they like, and generally what amount they'd like to receive. Take them bread or have them pick up bread from you. Bring the bread to Food not Bombs on Thursday, where it can be incorporated into the meal, given away, or composted. Make sandwiches IF I have a bunch of surplus ingredients that can be made into sandwich fixings and the time/energy to make sandwiches and either take them to a local org to distro or to the little free pantry at the Collingwood garden. Fill the little free pantry with as much bread as it will hold. Also, Equality Toledo will sometimes receive and distribute our bread donation; River or John Clark can help reach out to them if that's a route we want to regularly go with excess bread.

This guide should help members find information about how to access the church and how to securely close it up if they are the last ones to leave the church. Accessing the church Glenwood Lutheran Church is located at 2545 Monroe St . We currently access the church mainly to drop off food or supplies and to engage in the Thursday cooking events, although the church community has entrusted us with a lot of freedom and flexibility in using various spaces in the church. We enter by the eastern administrative doors (in the general center of the building as you face it from Monroe St), and the kitchen is downstairs and to the left. There is often a staff person available (usually Ellen) to remotely unlock the door if you press the intercom button and identify yourself as a member of Food Not Bombs (FNB). If a FNB member is already in the kitchen, they can also trigger the door to unlock remotely by picking up the phone in the kitchen when they hear the buzzer and pressing the flash button. If there is no one at the church to let members in, we will need someone with a key to unlock the church and disable the alarm system. See the list below for the current members who have a key and who have received instructions about the alarm system. When a group of FNB members arrives first for an event (such as a Thursday cooking event), someone needs to go upstairs to the usage tracking whiteboard (which has group names on it) and move the magnet to indicate that Food Not Bombs is present in the church. This whiteboard helps everyone know when the church is empty so that it needs to be secured. One of the current members who has a key or a contact at the church can inform others about the security system codes for enabling and disabling the alarm, and how to respond if the security alarm triggers. Securing the church after an event For Thursday cooking events, the FNB team for the day will need to include someone who has a key to the church and who is willing to lock the church at the end of the event. Cleaning up after events is covered in another section of this manual. When the event, including cleanup, is finished, the closing person will need to go upstairs to the usage tracking whiteboard and move the FNB magnet to indicate that we're no longer using the church. If there are no other groups using the church (which will almost always be the case on Thursdays), then the closing person will need to enable the security system, turn off all remaining lights, and lock the outer church doors. Members who currently have keys Chris Hanley (church pastor) John Clark Monika Perry Sadaf Niaz Sharing the kitchen We currently share the church's commercial-grade kitchen with several groups and organizations. Of these, we mainly balance our use of the kitchen with Opportunity Kitchen .

kitchen re-organization and a directory system for locating and returning items in the kitchen. All of the cupboards, drawers, and racks have signs with location codes and numbers on them; you can use this directory to find items that you need to use by looking them up by their name and identifying the corresponding location in the kitchen. If items or item names are missing from this directory, please tell John Clark about it. You can find a print version of this directory in the kitchen on the counter near the phone.","title":"Storing cookware and dishes"},{"location":"GLC/storage/#location-codes","text":"Code Location C
