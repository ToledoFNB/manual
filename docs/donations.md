### Bread

The Panera and Country Grains donations can often be a lot of bread and baked goods.  Here are some ideas for what to do with it, offered by River:

1. Pick out stuff me and my household will eat and put a loaf or 2 in the freezer for later.

2. Reach out to friends and make a list of which people would be happy to receive bread, what kinds of stuff they like, and generally what amount they'd like to receive. Take them bread or have them pick up bread from you.

3. Bring the bread to Food not Bombs on Thursday, where it can be incorporated into the meal, given away, or composted.

4. Make sandwiches IF I have a bunch of surplus ingredients that can be made into sandwich fixings and the time/energy to make sandwiches and either take them to a local org to distro or to the little free pantry at the Collingwood garden.

5. Fill the little free pantry with as much bread as it will hold.

6. Also, Equality Toledo will sometimes receive and distribute our bread donation; River or [John Clark](mailto:john.l.clark@gmail.com) can help reach out to them if that's a route we want to regularly go with excess bread.
