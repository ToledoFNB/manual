# Managing the sign-up sheets

We currently use [VolunteerSignup](https://volunteersignup.org/) to allow people to volunteer for tasks at our cooking events.  Since about 2022-09, [John Clark](mailto:john.l.clark@gmail.com) has been managing the sign-up sheets.

VolunteerSignup requires users to create a new sign-up sheet for each event, so currently John sets up the sign-up sheet early each week for the upcoming Thursday cooking event.

## Setting up sign-up sheets

We have a Google account with the `foodnotbombstoledo@gmail.com` Gmail address, and we use this email address for our VolunteerSignup account.  The password for the VolunteerSignup account is in Google Keep for that Google account.  If you need access to the Google account, talk with Monika Perry or John.

Once you have logged in to our VolunteerSignup account, choose the "My sheets" tab.  There, you can copy the previous sign-up sheet, give the new sheet a new name, and edit the details with any changes.  Then copy the signup sheet link and write a post with the link in the [Facebook group](communication.md#facebook-group) and the [Soup chat](communication.md#facebook-messenger-chat).
